"""Pydantic models for the artifacts the pipeline produces.

Per dataset, three artifacts land in `frontend/public/datasets/<id>/`:

    data.json         — DatasetMeta. Scanner-derived facts from CKAN
                        (license, resources, formats, …). Owned by the
                        publisher, sourced from Firestore `sources/<id>`.
    agent_data.json   — AgentData. Agent-derived judgments
                        (summary_he, dataset_kind, related_ids).
                        Sourced from Firestore `sources/<id>.agent_data`.
    content.html      — Body markup written by the agent. Synced via GCS.

`manifest.json` (consumed by home + category pages) is a merged view
(DatasetMeta + AgentData + computed `embedding` + `related_ids`).
